I build a server which can support on multi-clients.
The server handles three messages
1. respond with current server time.
2. respond with number of calls made to the server so far (since it started running).
3. multiplication of two numbers (the numbers will be supplied in the request).

For the last one we need 3 paramters from the user like this 
3 4 5
3 22 55

the server check incorrect input;

it was a nice work..
